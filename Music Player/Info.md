# Music Player
### Created using Python

It's a basic music player but does what's the need. Plays music! </br></br>
Though, it has some trivial features to help you:
* Add songs in bulk to playlist
* Remove songs from playlist
* Play/Pause/Stop
* Skip forward/backward
* Jump to a timeframe
* Volume manager
